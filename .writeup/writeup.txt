Description:
A game of life simulation with a color effect, buttons with different effects and a pattern picker.


Tech stack:
	React
	Node.js and Express (for a very basic server).
	Jest & enzyme (testing)
	Sass


Features:
	Every cell in a row has a different color which keeps changing.
	Run / pause button for stopping the simulation.
	Step button for advancing the simulation by a single step.
	Clear button to clear all cells.
	Reset button to restart the simulation with cells.
	Speed slider which sets the rate of cycles.
	Select dropdown which selects pattern to add to board when a cell is clicked.
	Clicking on the board adds / removes cells to the board based on the selected pattern. If a cell already exists, it is removed, otherwise it is added.


Implementation:
	2D array for the state of the board.
	React for the front-end.
	create-react-app to set up the project.
	App.js holds the program logic.
	Separate modules created for different logic, such as generating the initial board and applying the game of life rules to the board.
	Testing with Jest and enzyme.
	SCSS used along with a build script to process it to CSS.
	Node.js and Express for a very basic server (needed to upload to Heroku).
